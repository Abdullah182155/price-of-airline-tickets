# Flight Price Prediction

This project predicts flight ticket prices using machine learning, specifically a **Random Forest Regressor**. The notebook provides a full end-to-end workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and sample predictions.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset `Clean_Dataset.csv` contains the following features:

- `airline` â€“ Airline name
- `source_city` â€“ Departure city
- `destination_city` â€“ Arrival city
- `departure_time` â€“ Departure time
- `arrival_time` â€“ Arrival time
- `stops` â€“ Number of stops
- `class` â€“ Flight class (Economy/Business)
- `flight` â€“ Flight code
- `duration` â€“ Flight duration
- `days_left` â€“ Days left before flight
- `price` â€“ Target variable (flight price)

## ðŸ›  Features

- Handles **categorical and numerical features** using `ColumnTransformer`.
- Categorical features are **OneHotEncoded**.
- Numerical features are **StandardScaled**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model

- **Random Forest Regressor** is used for prediction.
- Evaluated using **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **RÂ²** metrics.
- Predictions are made on **random test samples** for comparison with true prices.

## ðŸš€ Workflow

1. Import libraries  
2. Load and explore dataset  
3. Preprocess features  
4. Split dataset into training and testing sets  
5. Build a pipeline with Random Forest  
6. Train and evaluate the model  
7. Predict random samples and compare results  

## ðŸ“Š Results

- The model predicts flight prices effectively and captures non-linear relationships in the data.
- Performance metrics allow assessment of model accuracy and reliability.

## âš¡ Notes

- The notebook can be extended to use other regression models like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or CatBoost.
- Hyperparameter tuning can improve Random Forest performance.
